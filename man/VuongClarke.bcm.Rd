\details{

The Vuong (1989) and Clarke (2007) tests are likelihood-ratio-based tests for model selection that use the 
Kullback-Leibler information criterion. The implemented tests can be used for choosing between two bivariate models which 
are non-nested. 

In the Vuong test, the null hypothesis is that the two models are equally close to the actual model, whereas 
the alternative is that one model is closer. The test follows asymptotically a standard normal 
distribution under the null. Assume that the critical region is \eqn{(-c,c)}, where \eqn{c} is typically set to 1.96. If the value 
of the test is higher than \eqn{c} then we reject the null hypothesis 
that the models are equivalent in favor of the model in \code{obj1}. Viceversa if the value is smaller than \eqn{c}. If 
the value falls in \eqn{[-c,c]} then we cannot discriminate between the two competing models given the data. 

In the Clarke test, if the two models are statistically equivalent then the log-likelihood ratios of the 
observations should be evenly distributed around zero 
and around half of the ratios should be larger than zero. The test follows asymptotically a binomial distribution with 
parameters \eqn{n} and 0.5. Critical values can be obtained as shown in Clarke (2007). Intuitively, 
the model in \code{obj1} is preferred over that in \code{obj2} if the value of the test 
is significantly larger than its expected value under the null hypothesis (\eqn{n/2}), and vice versa. If 
the value is not significantly different from \eqn{n/2} then \code{obj1} can be thought of as equivalent to \code{obj2}.

For details on the actual implementation of the tests see Radice, Marra and Wojtys (submitted).
